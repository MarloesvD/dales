## CASE DESCRIPTION: SULLIVAN2011
Convective boundary layer with a surface flux of 0.24 K m/s growing into a well mixed layer with a jump and stratification above. The Sullivan2011 case is described and documented in:
Sullivan, P. P., and E. G. Patton, 2011: The Effect of Mesh Resolution on Convective Boundary Layer Statistics and Structures Generated by Large-Eddy Simulation. J. Atmos. Sci., 68, 2395â€“2415, https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-10-05010.1. 

This folder contains all necessary input files to run the Sullivan2011 case, namely
	namoptions.001
	prof.inp.001
	lscale.inp.001

Further, it contains the following 
	dales_sullivan2011.py 				: script to generate new input files (e.g., after changing vertical levels)
	plot_profiles.py 				: a simple template script to plot time-averaged profiles from output and time series
	_temperature_heatflux_sullivan2011.png 		: example averaged profiles of temperature and the heat flux, with both deardorff tke subgrid scheme and smagorinsky subgrid scheme
	_frictionvelocity_obukhov_sullivan2011.png 	: example time series of friction velocity and Obukhov length, with both deardorff tke subgrid scheme and smagorinsky subgrid scheme 
	namoptions_SMAGORINSKY.001			: namoptions file for the use of the Smagorinsky subgrid scheme, the default one uses the Deardorff subgrid scheme. To use, replace the default one with this one.

Default settings in namoptions.001 use:
	kmax = 128 vertical levels
	itot = jtot = 128 gridpoints in the horizontal
	nx = ny = 4 processes in each direction (these can be freely changes as long as they are powers of 2 AND itot and jtot are divisible by them

When changing the amount of vertical levels, new input files must be created using the python script:
	python3 dales_sullivan2011.py -iexpr 001
