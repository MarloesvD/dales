## CASE DESCRIPTION: GABLS1
A weakly stable boundary layer is created by a slow constant cooling of the surface temperature. The GABLS1 case is extensively described and documented in:
Beare, R.J. et al. An Intercomparison of Large-Eddy Simulations of the Stable Boundary Layer. Boundary-Layer Meteorol 118, 247â€“272 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-004-2820-6

This folder contains all necessary input files to run the GABLS1 case, namely
	namoptions.001
	prof.inp.001
	lscale.inp.001
	ls_flux.inp.001

Further, it contains the following 
	dales_gabls1.py 		: script to generate new input files (e.g., after changing vertical levels)
	plot_profiles.py 		: a simple template script to plot time-averaged profiles from output and time series
	_wind_temperature_gabls1.png 	: example averaged profiles of wind and temperature, with both deardorff tke subgrid scheme and smagorinsky subgrid scheme
	_flux_momheat_gabls1.png 	: example average profiles of momentum flux and heat flux, with both deardorff tke subgrid scheme and smagorinsky subgrid scheme 
	namoptions_SMAGORINSKY.001	: namoptions file for the use of the Smagorinsky subgrid scheme, the default one uses the Deardorff subgrid scheme. To use, replace the default one with this one.

Default settings in namoptions.001 use:
	kmax = 128 vertical levels
	itot = jtot = 128 gridpoints in the horizontal
	nx = ny = 4 processes in each direction (these can be freely changes as long as they are powers of 2 AND itot and jtot are divisible by them

When changing the amount of vertical levels, new input files must be created using the python script:
	python3 dales_gabls1.py -iexpr 001
